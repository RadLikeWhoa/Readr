# Readr

Readr is a free Tumblr theme with a strong focus on text and photos. From the beginning it was designed to offer an ideal reading experience — which is also the origin of the name — using great typography.

## Features

* Support for **all post types**. Seriously, all of them.
* A **wide range of options**. Adapt the design to your taste. Readr lets you decide what you want to be shown and what not. And the color scheme, it's entirely up to you.
* **HD video** in 16:9 format.
* **Widgets** for Twitter, Followings and links to other networks.
* A **responsive theme**. All you need to do is disable Twitter's own mobile theme.

## The Story

Version 1 was focused on minimalism; the design was built atop of a few colours and little decorative elements. This design lived on for three minor revisions, mostly just adding requested features. But when it came to create the next big iteration I didn't just want to add features; I wanted to shake the whole thing up quite a bit. So I did.

2.0 brings an entirely new look. Everything's a bit larger with lots of whitespace. Over time the focus shifted: Text was no longer the primary purpose of Readr, photos and videos took over. That's why 2.0 now offers beautiful HD content, videos even adapt an ideal 16:9 format. That shift in focus doesn't mean typography didn't get a huge boost. I switched from Georgia to a combination of Source Sans Pro and Droid Serif, the former for most of the design's type, the latter for quote posts. Those faces make the design look much more sophisticated and clean.

This version also adds improved support for various types of posts. Chat, audio, quote, and link posts have gotten a massive makeover, resulting in very obvious changes to their appearance and behavior.

As it is a .0 release, things might be a little whacky here and there, but most of the theme should be ready.

## The Future

In the future, I plan to add more widgets (e.g. Instagram, Flickr, etc.) and more options for customisation.
